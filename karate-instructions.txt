Laplacian based partition:

Lowest non-zero eigenvalue: 0.468525226701
Group sizes: 19 15
Cut size is 10

Is there more than one minimum cut?  See the figure on this page in
the paper:

Notes:
- Derive the formula for \Delta Q yourself.  The variables e_ij and
  a_i, a_j in the paper are confusing.
